# TreePlayground
#### Tree Visualization Tool for Learning Data Structure and Algorithm.


## Start
Just visit https://hwc0919.github.io/tree/ , or download contents in folder 'docs' to run offline.
[Backup Link](http://192.144.210.149/).

Program can run perfectly on Chrome and Firefox. Windows Edge is only functional when exploring online.


## start using
Can be accessed directly https://hwc0919.github.io/tree/ , You can also download the content in the folder "docs" and run it locally. 
[Alternate link](http://192.144.210.149/).

Chrome and Firefox browsers work fine. Edge browser works online.

## Objective 
This project is designed to help students who study the search tree-related chapters of the data structure course (I strongly recommend the data structure class of Professor Deng Junhui of Tsinghua University, which can be found at [Xuetang Online](https://next.xuetangx.com/)Learn for free).

The project plans to build a "tree playground"", Including general binary trees, BST, AVL, Splay, RedBlack, etc...

Here users can freely build a tree structure, dynamically insert, delete, search nodes, and traverse nodes.

All operations are dynamic, with step-by-step visual feedback.


## Some detail 
This project is implemented using html5, typescript, vue.js, and packaged with webpack. The project entry is an html file, which can be run directly locally.

In order to achieve dynamics, a lot of asynchronous code is used, which has some impact on the readability of the code.

Red-black trees have not yet implemented step visualization.

If you find a bug, please submit it in Issue, thank you very much.
